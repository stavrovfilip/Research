"AI - project"

The main idea of this project is to represent a central place for all Artificial Intelligence enthusiasts.

The website will offer the users a chance to find researches and papers in different areas of AI, and help them broaden their knowledge.
Users will be able to look at the papers, add them as their favourites, and also be able to create their own papers.
After the creation, the users will be able to edit their papers, or delete them.
This part of the application is dedicated to help the people that are working or studying in any AI field to quickly find helpful resources.

Besides that, the website will offer a part that is designeted for allowing user comunication, in the sense of a forum.
Here, the users will be able to ask questions about things they are not sure, or give answers to questions posed by a fellow colleague.
So, this part of the application will allow the users to quickly learn new things and solve their problems.
